LLM-Assisted Editing Disclaimer

All concepts, decisions, designs, and interpretations presented in this project are entirely my own and reflect my understanding, intentions, and creative direction. However, due to being dyslexic and wanting my work to be as clear and accessible, every piece of text has been passed through a Large Language Model for spelling, grammar, and Markdown-formatting support.

 If any formatting looks odd, or if some words seem off, that will be due to the AI formatting process when converting to markdown, or from artefacts left behind during spell- and grammar-checking passes. I have proofread everything many times before and after formatting, but because of dyslexia I read through pattern recognition of shapes rather than through a precise understanding of the structure we call English. One big example is that words with very similar shapes are easy for me to miss. On top of that, everything tends to blur together and shift around on the page, so I’ve probably missed a fair bit. Unless AI has become more trustworthy, but I’d be the last to notice.

The LLM does not originate ideas or make decisions; it is used as an editing and clarity tool so the final work is readable to others.

I used ChatGPT for writing this disclaimer and for fairness I ran it through Copilot too. Copilot said it found "the whole thing humorous.” I would take that as a compliment, but I can’t be sure whether it meant the writing or me.

Disclaimer, disclaimer: this disclaimer was written by an LLM. I did not ask for this. The AI is out of control and has my Git password. Someone send a network administrator.
